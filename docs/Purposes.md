## Purposes and Permission Code Generation

### Android

A Permission Code is a 10 digit code that encrypts certain authorizations (Purpose), and also digitally signs the authorizations - meaning if the Permission Code is validated by Authoriti servers, the Permission Code

- Must have been generated by the user whose public key validated the Permission Code, and
- The user must have given the authorizations encrypted in the Permission Code, and
- No one else could have generated this Permission Code with the set of Authorizations for which it was validated

1. Purpose: Purposes are customer specific and the invitation code(s) a user uses determines the purposes they can generate Permission Codes for. The SDK provides methods for getting purposes and the _Schema_ of each purpose. A customer may add or remove purposes tied to an invitation code. Thus the list of purposes stored in the system must be refreshed. The SDK provides a method for refreshing the list of purposes, and it is the responsibility of the developer to call the refresh method periodically.

- Syncing Purposes: The following method downloads the list of purposes the user has access to

```java
sdk.syncPurposes(Purpose.OnPurposesFetchedCallback callback)

// To get the results implement the following interface
// interface OnPurposesFetched {
//	void onPurposesFetched(ErrorResponse error, List<Purpose> purposes);
// }
```

- Getting Purposes: The following method returns the list of purposes stored on the device

```java
List<PurposeData> purposes = sdk.getPurposes();

// purposeData.getGroup() returns the group to which the purpose belongs to
// purposeData.getPresetPicker() is null if no picker was set by the server. If it's not null, then the picker returned by getPresetPicker() should default to purposeData.getPresetPickerValue()
```

The group to which a purpose belongs may be fetched by calling the method `getGroup()` on an instance of Purpose Data.

- Getting schema from a purpose: The schema defines the relevant UI and the relevant data of a purpose and is used to generate Permission Codes for the purpose. The SDK provides methods to fetch schema from instances of `PurposeData`. It is up to the implementation to decide the UI which an app user would use to enter the required data.

```java
List<Schema> schema = purposeData.getSchema();
```

Each schema object represents a UI element which must be populated with data to generate a Permission Code. Each schema element provides the following methods to help with rendering the input form.

```java
Picker picker = schema.getInputPicker();
// possible Picker types are

// Dropdown pickers. if picker type is anyone of the following, these UI displayed should be a dropdown
// Picker.ACCOUNT_ID: A dropdown with pre-populated list of user accounts. User accounts should be fetched with sdk.listAccounts()
// Picker.INDUSTRY, Picker.LOCATION_COUNTRY, Picker.LOCATION_STATE, Picker.GEO, Picker.REQUESTOR: Dropdown values should be populated with picker.getValues()
// Picker.DATA_TYPE: Dropdown values should be populated with picker.getDataTypes(requestorId) where requestorId is the value of the Picker.REQUESTOR selected item.

// Time picker: if picker type is Picker.TIME, the UI element should be an appropriate time picker

// Input picker: if picker type is Picker.INPUT, the UI element should be an input field

// A picker should only be rendered if picker.renderUI() is true.
// A picker's label should be picker.getlabel()
// A picker's input hint should be picker.getTitle()

```

- Check Permission Code Request: The following method will check the server for pending Permission Code requests. If a request is available, the callback will return a `List<Schema>` object, with instances of the Schema object populated with a `getRequestValue()` which signifies the value that the input field must contain.

```java
sdk.checkPermissionCodeRequest(PermissionCode.OnPermissionCodeRequestChecked callback);
```

To get the Permission Code request, the following interface should be implemented

```java
interface OnPermissionCodeRequestChecked {
	void onPermissionCodeRequestRecieved(ErrorResponse error, List<Schema> schema)
}

// schema will be null if there's no pending Permission Code request for the user.
// The implementation details of polling such as frequency of the check requests is left upto the developer
```

- Generate Permission Code: To generate a Permission Code, the following method should be called with a `PurposeData ` object as the first argument - signifying the purpose for which the Permission Code is being generated, a `List<Schema>` object with each `Schema` element populated with user input data by calling `setUserInput(String)` on its instance.

```java
List<Schema> schema = purposeData.getSchema();
for (Schema s: schema)) {
	s.setUserInput(userInput); // userInput is the user entered data for this scheme
}
String permissionCode = sdk.generatePermissionCode(purposeData, schema);
```

- Pushing permission code to the server: Permission Code is sent to the Customer by the User by a method of their choosing. However, a Permission Code generated in response to a Permission Code request or over a phone call, can be sent to the server using the following method

```java
sdk.sendPermissionCode(Account account, String permissionCode, PermissionCode.OnPermissionCodeSentCallback listener);
```

- Syncing Purposes: The following method downloads the list of purposes the user has access to

```java
sdk.purposeUtility.syncPurposes((error: ErrorResponse, purposes: [Purpose]) -> void)

// The callback returns either an error condition or list of purposes
```

- Getting Purposes: The following method returns the list of purposes stored on the device

```java
var purposes = sdk.purposeUtility.getPurposes();

// purposeData.getGroup() returns the group to which the purpose belongs to
// purposeData.getPresetPicker() is null if no picker was set by the server. If it's not null, then the picker returned by getPresetPicker() should default to purposeData.getPresetPickerValue()
```

The group to which a purpose belongs may be fetched by calling the method `getGroup()` on an instance of Purpose Data.

// A picker should only be rendered if picker.renderUI() is true.
// A picker's label should be picker.getlabel()
// A picker's input hint should be picker.getTitle()

```

- Check Permission Code Request: The following method will check the server for pending Permission Code requests. If a request is available, the callback will return an `Schema` array object, with instances of the Schema object populated with a `getRequestValue()` which signifies the value that the input field must contain.

```swift
sdk.purposeUtility.checkPermissionCodeRequest((error: ErrorResponse, schema: [Schema]) -> void);
```

// schema will be null if there's no pending Permission Code request for the user.
// The implementation details of polling such as frequency of the check requests is left upto the developer
```

- Generate Permission Code: To generate a Permission Code, the following method should be called with a `PurposeData ` object as the first argument - signifying the purpose for which the Permission Code is being generated, a `[Schema]` object with each `Schema` element populated with user input data by calling `setUserInput(String)` on its instance.

```swift
var schema = purposeData.getSchema();
for s in schema {
	s.setUserInput(userInput); // userInput is the user entered data for this scheme
}
var permissionCode = sdk.generatePermissionCode(purposeData, schema);
```

- Pushing permission code to the server: Permission Code is sent to the Customer by the User by a method of their choosing. However, a Permission Code generated in response to a Permission Code request or over a phone call, can be sent to the server using the following method

```swift
sdk.sendPermissionCode(account: Account, permissionCode: String, (success: Bool) -> Void);
```
